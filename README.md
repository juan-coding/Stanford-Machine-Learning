# Machine Learning by Stanford University on Coursera

The repo contains all the programming assignments code. 

This course took me two months to finish, which is a very exciting and fruitful journey for me. I do enjoy it a lot. Although I find it 
not difficult to finish the programming assignments, but it worths a lot to review all the code files now and then to get a deep understanding
of how to develop, apply, and evaluate the learning algorithms.
